Welcome to ConcertTrack!
The new, quick, and exciting way to find your favorite artists and where they're heading.

Search for any artist using the search bar and if they have concert dates scheduled they will show up on the map. 
You can then filter by dates and location to find a concert near you. Click on the concert to find out where and when it is. 
You can also find out more about the headline artist or buy tickets which links you to a different website where you can purchase. 


The application was built using AngularJS and the MaterializeCSS frameworks.
